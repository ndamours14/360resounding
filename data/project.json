    "description": "A fusion of past and present technology. Literary recordings from the 1960s-80s are played on a 1960s Sony TC-102 portable reel-to-reel tape player, in the same Edmonton locations where they were originally recorded decades earlier. This 360° video was recorded using an Insta360 X4 camera and a Zoom H3-VR ambisonic mic, and can be viewed using a VR headset to visually and sonically place the viewer inside the recorded moment.",
